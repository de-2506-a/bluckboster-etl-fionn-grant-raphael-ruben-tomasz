Epic:
I want to create and present multiple visualisations of the main schema hosted in pagila, so that I can perform analysis on the data and provide useful insights

User Story 1:
As a presenter I want to be able to find out how many times different genres were rented by country, so that I am able to display the most popular genres by country in a graph

User Story 2:
As a presenter I want to be able to find out how much money each film has made, so that I am able to display the most popular films

User Story 3:
As a presenter I want to be able to find out how many times each actor appears in each rental, so that I am able to display the most popular actors

User Story 4:
As a presenter I want to be able to find out how many films were rented during each month, so that I am able to display what time of the year is most popular to rent films

Tasks:
- Create pyproject.toml
  - Create pyproject.toml to ensure two scripts can be run
  - Script 1: run_etl - Run extract and transform concurrently on command
  - Script 2: run_tests - Run unit tests to improve code robustness
- Connect to database
  - Create personal .env file containing details required to connect to the pagila database
  - Ensure that code is able to retrieve connection details and use them to create authorised connection to postgres database
- Extract tables from database
  - actor
  - address
  - category
  - city
  - country
  - customer
  - film
  - film_actor
  - film_category
  - inventory
  - payment
  - rental
- Store raw tables
  - Store tables in folder data/raw/ for later transforming
- Explore the data for cleaning in transform.ipynb
  - Identify null values and determine resolution
  - Identify duplicate records and determine resolution
  - Identify variable date formats and determine resolution
  - Identify erroneous column typing and determine resolution
- Transform the extracted tables and store in data/cleaned
  - Implement null values resolution
  - Implement duplicate records resolution
  - Implement variable date format resolution
  - Implement erroneous column typing resolution
- Perform analysis on cleaned data
  - Explore cleaned data to identify useful analysis
- Create visualisations
  - Genre count by country
  - Total amount by film
  - Total actor appearance count by rental
  - Film rent count by month
- Prepare presentation
  - Determine method (PowerPoint or Streamlit)
